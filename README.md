QRMaps
======

This is a (really simple) Google Chrome(tm) extension that inserts a small button to Google Maps(tm) pages for quickly generating QR codes for the location or directions currently being viewed.

For people (like me) who don't use QR codes for anything but getting maps to their phone and are not keen on toolbar clutter.
